# Introduction
Poggle is a React Component library aimed at speeding up the development of React websites. Poggle was built using TypeScript, to make it scalable and also minimise errors when developing. Poggle
has many prebuilt components that allow you to easily setup a website or project.

The goal of Poggle was to make it easier for freelancers or teams to build and test an idea in under an hour, drastically reducing the development process to validate ideas.

### Ahead of the release of Poggle, we decided to launch our colour library!
